        <h1>Industrial Organizational Psychology</h1>
        <p>While this class was not hard, it was somewhat tedious to get though (it's HR), but I am glad I did.  Understanding some of the theory and processes used in the workplace really helps when applying for jobs, working, and I assume when one is placed in a position of leadership. As a software developer, the process of designing jobs is similar to designing software, and both employ systems thinking which may be userful, especially if the workforce is moving towards a time where humans direct and conduct autonomous agents.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-WWI (initial): In 1901, Walter Dill Scott was invited by a western advertising manager of a chain of magazines at the Agate Club in Chicago. He published <i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=theory+of+advertising+walter+dill+scott">The Theory of Advertising</a></i> in 1903.  That same year, the <i>The Division of Applied Psychology</i> was established at Carnegie Tech (Carnegie Mellon) headed by Walter VanDyke Bingham, with Scott being its first professor in 1915. Hugo Mustenburg also published <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=psychology+and+industrial+efficiency+hugo+mustenburg">Psychology and Industrial Efficiency</a> in 1913.</li>
          <li>WWI~1920s (academia > applied world): Scott and Bingham established personnel files and the creation of performace rating forms in the Army. Robert Yerkes (then president of the APA) developed <i>Army Alpha and Army Beta</i> mental ability tests that were used to select and classify army personnel. Frederick Taylor wrote <i>Scientific Management</i> while <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/preserving/2018/09/05/lillian-moller-gilbreth-the-mother-of-modern-management/">Lillian Gilbreth</a> (Mother of Scientific Managment) published her dissertation, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=psychology+of+management+lillian+gilbreth"></a>.</li>
          <li>1930s~Pre-WWII: The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/hawthorne/09.html#fnl11">Hawthorne Studies</a> at the Western Electric plant in Hawthorne, Illinois (during the Great Depression), where researchers changed light intensities but discovered that workers reported changes based on viewing of lighting, and the researchers realized that social and psychological conditons of work (being watched) were often more important than the physical conditions.</li>
          <li>WWII~Mid-1960s (large I/O research groups established in comprations and military):<a target="_blank" href="https://ari.altess.army.mil/history.aspx">Army Research Institute</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.afrl.af.mil/About-Us.aspx">Air Force Human Resources Laboratory (AFHRL)</a> research centers were created.</li>
          <li>Mid-1960s~Mid-1980s: APA Division 14 changed their name to "Division of I/O Psychology", doctoral I/O programs emerged, and the 'Division of I/O Psychology' grew.</li>
          <li>Mid-1980s~2000: Increase in I/O doctoral programs and new issues like DEI.</li>
          <li>2000~Today: There is a growth and focus on globalization, a virtual workforce, and coaching and developing top talent.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Job Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Job Analysis - process of defining a job in terms of its component tasks or duties and the knowledge / skills required to perform them.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Element - smallest unit of work activity</li>
            <li>Task - activity performed to achieve a specific objective</li>
            <li>Position - individuals place defined by the tasks performed</li>
            <li>Job - collection of positions similar enough to one another to share a common job title</li>
            <li id="KSAO">KSAOs - knowledge, skills, abilities, and (other) characteristics required for successful job performance</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Here, the focus is on the position itself, not the person who holds it. The <i>task-oriented approach</i> focuses on
          describing various tasks that are performed on the job, while the <i>worker-oriented approach</i> examines broad human
          behaviors involved in work activites.
        </p>
        <h3>Task Oriented Techniques</h3>
        <p>Functinal Job Analysis (FJA) - data are obtained about what tasks a worker does and how those tasks are obtained</p>
          <p>Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) - tools developed by the Department of Labor in the 1930s that has been used to classify occupations and jobs, consisting of narrative descriptions of tasks, duties, and working conditions of about 12,000 jobs</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Occuatpional Code</li>
            <li>Occupational Title</li>

            <li>Lead Statement</li>
            <li>Task Element Statements</li>
            <li>'May' Items</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Occuatpinal Information Network Content Model:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Worker Characteristics</li>

          Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) - a structured job analysis technique that asks subject matter experts to evaluate a job in terms of the abilities required to perform the job
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information Input - where and how does the worker get the information he uses in performing his job?</li>
          <li>Mental Processes - what reasoning, decision-making, planning, and infromation-processing activities are involved in performing the job?</li>
          <li>Work Output - what physical activites does the worker perfrom and what tools does she use?</li>
          <li>Relationships with Other People - what relationships with oterh people are required in performing the job?</li>
          <li>Job Context - in what pysical or social contexts is the work performed?</li>
          <li>Other Job Characteristics - what activites, conditions, or characteristics are relevant to the job?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Common-metric Questionnaire (CMQ) - attempts to improve the generalizability of worker-oriented approaches through the use of items focused on slighly less general work behaviors
        </p>
        <p>
          Strategic Job Analysis - considers the status of jobs as they currently exist but also factors in how jobs are likely to change in the future as a result of anticipated organizational or industrial changes
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job Description - written statement of what jobholders actually do, how they do it, and why they do it</li>
          <ul>
            <li>"...and performs other job-related duties as assigned."</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Job Specifications ('Job specs') - delineating the <a href="#KSAO">KSAOs</a> required for successful job performance</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Task Characteristics (autonomy & task variety)</li>
          <li>Knowledge Characteristics (reflect traditional KSAOs)</li>
          <li>Social Characteristics (social support & feedback from others)</li>
          <li>Contextual Chracteristics (physical demands & work conditions)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Job Evaluation - technique that attempts to determine the value or worth of particular jobs to organizations so that salaries can be set accordingly
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Compensable Factors - characteristics of jobs that an organization values and chooses to pay for</li>
          <li>Job Evaluation Methods</li>

            <li>Point Method - jobs are broken down into components or factors, each of which is rated and scored</li>
            <li>Factor Comparison - jobs are ranked based on a variety of factors, such as effort and skill, responsibility, and working conditions</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Comparable Worth - doctrine maintaining that jobs of equal (or comparable) worth to the organization should be

        </p>
        <h3>Criteria for Criteria</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Relevance - extent to which the actual criterion measure is realated to the ultimate criterion</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Criterion Deficiency - dimensions in the ultimate measure are not part of or are not captured by the actual measure</li>
            <li>Criterion Contamination - condition in which things measured by the actual criterion are not part of the ultimate criterion (bias and error)</li>
