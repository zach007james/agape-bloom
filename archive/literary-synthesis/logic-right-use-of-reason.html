        <h1>An Introduction to the Untaught Cultivation of the Mind: <i>Watt's Logic</i></h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Buy and read this book multiple times - it was the Logic texbook used in primary schools and eventually at Harvard, Oxford, Cabridge, and Yale for over 200 years.  Watts defines <i>logic</i> as "the art of using Reason [all the intellectual powser of man] well in our inquiries after truth, and the communication of it to others" (1).  He separates and explains from four points:</p>
		<ol>
						<li>Perception: the "simple contemplation of things offered to our mind, without affirming or denying any thing concerning them," resulting in an idea (5).</li>
						<li>Judgment: the operation joining "two or more ideas together by one affirmation or negation," resulting in a proposition (5).</li>
						<li>Reasoning (Argumentation): inferring one proposition from two or more propositions premised, resulting in a conclusion or inference (5).</li>
						<li>Disposition: putting "ideas, propositions, and arguments... into such an order as is fittest to gain the clearest knowedge of it, to retain it longest, and to explain it to others in the best manner," resulting in a method (6).</li>

      <h2>Perception and Ideas</h2>
				<p>Watts declares that "all... knowledge... is founded upon our conceptions and ideas" (7). <strong>Perception</strong> is the "act of mind... whereby the mind becomes conscious of any thing" (8).  An <b>idea</b> is the "representation of a thing in the mind... the object of perception," while <strong>conception</strong> is "forming an idea of the object whether present or absent" (7-8). The <b>theme</b> is the "object of our idea" and <b>being</b> is either <b>as possible</b>, "an essence or nature," or <b>as actual</b>, which "has existence also" (9-10). <b>Essence</b> is "the very nature of any being" while a <b>substance</b> exists "in and by itself..., without dependence upon any other created being... it cannot be annihilated, or utterly destroyed and reduced to nothing..., though its present particular form, nature and properties, may be altered and destroyed by many inferior causes" (10-1).</p>
				<p><b>Simple substances</b> "have no matter or composition in them... [or] are the first principles of bodies... of which all bodies are composed" - a synonym being an <b>element</b> which "cannot be resolved or reduced into two or more substances of different kinds" (14). <b>Compound substances</b> are "made up of two or more simple substances" (14). <b>Animal (Animated) substances</b> have "various organical and instrumental parts, fitted by a variety of motions from place to place, and a spring of life within themselves," while <b>inanimate substances</b> "have no sort of life in them" (15-6).</p>
				<p><b>Mode (manner of being)</b> "subsists in and by another" and "cannot subsist in and of itself, [always] belonging to, and subsisting by, the help of some substance [its <b>subject</b>],... and extends to all attributes whatsoever, and includes the most essential and inward properties, as well as outward respects and relations, and reaches to actions themselves, as well as matters of action" (10 & 16). Modes are <b>essential</b> when the "subject can never have the same nature without it" - in a <b>primary</b> sense if it is the "first or chief thing aht constitues any being in its particular essence or nature" or a <b>property</b> (in the <b>secondary</b> sense) if "any other attribute of a thing, which is not a primary consideration" - or an <b>accident</b> when "not necessary to the being of a thing" (17-8). This is determined by the <b>essential difference</b>, the "one property or essential attribute, so superior to the rest, that it appears so plainly that all the rest are derived from it, and such as is sufficient to give a full distinction of that subject from all other subjects... [where] the essence of the thing consists in it" (20). <b>Absolute</b> mode "belongs to its subject, without respect to any other beings whatsoever," <b>realtive</b> mode (<b>relation</b>) is "derived from the regard that one being has to others" - being either <b>real</b> as they "arise from the nature of things" or <b>mental</b> because "they arise merely from the operation of the mind," from <b>second notions (entia rationis)</b> which "have no real being but by the operations of the mind" (20-1). Modes can be <b>intrisic</b> "in the subject or substance" or <b>extrinsic</b>, arising "from something that is not in the substance or subject itself... something that is external or foreign to the subject" (21-2). <b>Adherent (improper)</b> modes "arise from the joining of some accidental substace to the chief subject, which yet may be separated from it" while <b>inherent (proper) modes</b> "have a sort of in-being in the substance itself, and do not arise from the addition of any other substance of it" (22). <b>Action</b> (doing) by an <b>agent</b> (doer) inflicts <b>passion</b> (suffering) with a <b>patient</b>, the "subject of passion... [and] receives the operation of the agent" (22). <b>Modes of body (qualities)</b>, "belonging... to matter or corporeal beings," are <b>primary</b>, belonging "to bodies considered in themselves, whether there were any man to take notice of them or no," or <b>secondary (sensible)</b>, "ideas... we ascribe to bodies on accound of the various impressions which are made on the senses of men by them" (23). Additionally, there are <b>modes of spirit</b> which include "mind... knowledge, assent, dissent, doubting, reasoning, &c" and <b>mixed (human) modes</b> such as "sensation, imagination, passion" (23).</p>
				<p>"All comparative and superlative degrees of any quality, are the modes of a mode" (24). Aristotle had ten predicatments, categories, or ranks of being Watts mentions: substances, quantity, quality, relation, action, passion, when, where, situation, and clothing (25). Watts then describes <i>not-being</i>, defining <b>pure nullity</b> ('<b>mere nothing</b>') as "exclusing all substance, and then all modes," <b>negation</b> as the "absence of that which does not naturally belong to the thing we are speaking of," and <b>privation</b> as the "absence of what does naturally belong to the thing we are speaking of" (26). Will conlcuding the first two chapters, Watts states that the "essence of sincerity is the conformity of our words and actions to our thoughts" (26).</p>
				<p>In chapter three, Watts covers ideas. <b>Sensible (corporeal)</b> ideas are "derived... from [the] senses, and... communication which the sould has with the animal body" (28). <b>Spiritual (intellectual)</b> ideas, framed by abstractions, are "withdrawing some parts of an idea from other parts of it" - either in an <b>absolute (general / universal)</b> sense such as "entity or being, and not-being, essence, existence, act, power, substance, mode, accident, &c" or <b>relative</b> sense which "compare several things together, and consider merely the relations of one thing to another, entirely dropping the subject of those relations... [as with] cause, effect, likeness, unlikeness, subject, object, identity, or sameness, and contrariety, order" (30-1). A <b>simple</b> idea is "one uniform idea, which cannot be divided or distinguished by the mind of man into two or more ideas" while a <b>complex</b> idea is "made by joining two or more simple ideas together... [including] every thing that can be divided by the mind into two or more ideas" (32-3). <b>Compound</b> ideas are made up of "several... ideas of a different kind joined together, which are wont to be considered as distinct single beings... [and] unites a thing of a different kind" while a <b>collective</b> idea unites "things of the same kind" (33-4). <b>Particular</b> ideas "represent one thing only" while a <b>singular</b> idea "represents a particular idea in a determinant manner... usually limited to one singular, certain, and determined object" (34). <b>Universal</b> ideas "represent a common nature agreeing to several particular things... [are] formed by abstraction... withdrawling some part of an idea from other parts of it" (34-5). Ideas can be categorized by <b>general (genus)</b> via "one common nature agreeing to several other natures" - <b>remote genus</b> being where "one thing agrees with most other things" - or <b>special (species)</b> via "one common nature... agrees to several singular species" (35-6). <b>Subaltern</b> ideas are universal ideas that "may either be considered as a genus or a species," where "the highest genus [is] the most general... [and] the lowest species... the most special" (36).</p>
				<p><b>Real</b> ideas "have a just foundation in nature, and have real objects, or examplars, which did, or do, or may actually exist, according to the present state and nature of things" while <b>imaginary (fantastical / chimerical)</b> ideas are "made by enlarging, diminishing, uniting, dividing real ideas in the mind, in such a manner as no objects or examplars did or ever will exist, according to the present course of nature" (37-8). A <b>clear and distinct</b> idea "represents the object of the mind with full evidence and strength, and plainly distinguishes it from all other objects whatsoever" while an <b>obscure and confused</b> idea "represents the object either so faintly, so imperfectly, or so mingled with other ieads, that the object of it doth not appear plain to the mind, nor purely in its own nature, nor sufficiently distinguised from other things" (38). A <b>vulgar</b> idea is "the most obvious and sensible appearances that are contained in the object of them" while a <b>learned</b> idea "penetrates farther into the nature, properties, reasons, causes, and effects of things" (40). <b>Adequate</b> ideas "perfectly represent their archetypes or objects," <b>inadequate</b> ideas only have a "partial or incomplete representation of those archetypes to which they are referred," <b>complete</b> ideas represent "the perfect idea of any thing in all its parts," and <b>comprehensive</b> ideas represent the perfect idea of any thing "in all its properties" (42).</p>
				<p>
					The <b>comprehension of an idea</b> "regards all the essential modes and properties of it" while the <b>extension of a universal idea</b> "regards all the particular kinds and single beings taht are contained under it" (36-7). The prior explanation of ideas applies to the <b>doctrine of universals</b>, which says that "every thing that is affirmed concerning any being must be" one of the <b>five predicatables</b>: genus, species, difference (primary essential mode), property (secondary essential mode), or accident (accidental essential mode) (37). <b>True</b> ideas are "conformable to the object or archetype of it," else they are false (43). When ending chapter three, Watts warns that "generally, where there is falsehood in ideas, there seems to be some secret or latent proposition, whereby we judge falsely of things. ... [But] since ideas are pictures of thing, it can never be very improper to pronounce them to be true or false according to their conformity or nonconformity to their examplars" (44-5).
				</p>
				<p>
					In the use of reasoning and judgement, it is essential to first define the words you use, understanding that words "have no natural connection with the ideas they are designed to signify, nor with the things which are represented in these ideas... [and] when single words signify complex ideas, one word can never distinctly manifest all the parts of a complex idea" (45). So, to "avoid error in our pursuit of knowledge, we must take good heed to the use of words and terms, and be acquainted with the various kinds of them" (51).

					<b>Negative</b> terms "have a little word or syllable of denying joined to them" while <b>positive</b> terms "have no... negative appendices belonging to them" (51).
