        <h2>Scaling Real Food: The (Confidential) Master Plan</h2>
        <p>Scaling Real Food is a project that I have been working on for the past 3 years. It is a project that is
          dedicated to democratizing real food. I believe that real food should be accessible to everyone, not just the
          elite. I believe that real food should be affordable, delicious, and nutritious. I believe that real food
          should be sustainable, ethical, and equitable. I believe that real food should be a human right, not a luxury.
          I believe that real food should be a public good, not a private commodity. I believe that real food should be
          a social movement, not a market niche. I believe that real food should be a cultural revolution, not a consumer
          fad. I believe that real food should be a political agenda, not a personal choice. I believe that real food
          should be a global priority, not a local option. I believe that real food should be a universal value, not a
          regional preference. I believe that real food should be a planetary imperative, not a national interest. I
          believe that real food should be a cosmic imperative, not a human prerogative. I believe that real food should
          be a divine imperative, not a secular prerogative. I believe that real food should be a spiritual imperative,
          not a material prerogative. I believe that real food should be a moral imperative, not an economic prerogative.
          I believe that real food should be a social imperative, not a personal prerogative. I believe that real food
          should be a political imperative, not a private prerogative. I believe that real food should be a public
          imperative, not a private prerogative. I believe that real food should be a global imperative, not a local
          prerogative. I believe that real food should be a universal imperative, not a regional prerogative. I believe
          that real food should be a planetary imperative, not a national prerogative. I believe that real food should be
          a cosmic imperative, not a human prerogative. I believe that real food should be a divine imperative, not a
          secular prerogative. I believe that real food should be a spiritual imperative, not a material prerogative. I
