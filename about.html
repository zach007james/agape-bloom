        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Zach James, a computer science and mathematics undergraduate student at Louisiana State University, where
          I'm exploring the intersection of technology and human behavior through my minor in psychology. In my free
          time, I enjoy creating music, running, writing, and exploring philosophy and theology.</p>

        <p><strong>Values and Ethics:</strong> The human heart longs for a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a
          beauty to rescue (John Eldredge, Wild at Heart). I try to follow the following advice a Godly person once gave
          me: “Achieve the maximal amount you can achieve. Be the servant who, when his master left, earned the most
          return on that which he had been entrusted. Do what you do to God’s glory. ... If Godly ambition has placed us
          in a position of power, then we should empty ourselves of personal ambition/selfishness and take on the form
          of a servant/slave to become the leader whom God wishes us to be” (Mr. B on Matthew 10:15 & 10:42-45). With
          this perspective, I can “eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun
          the few days of his life that God has given him.... For he will not much remember the days of his life because
          God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart” (Ecclesiastes 5:18-20). Thus, as Augustine says, “Love God and
          do what you will.” </p>

        <p><strong>Breaking Rules, Skepticism, and Libertarian Tilt:</strong> General Douglas MacArthur famously said
          that you are remembered for the rules you break. I strive to honor Christ, submitting to Biblical authority.
          In practice, this looks like obeying a boss at work (because I have chosen to work there and submit myself to
          their authority), carrying out their instructions in service of Christ - my ultimate authority - “not as
          eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,
          rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does, this
          he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or free” (Ephesians 6:6-8). Those with
          rational Asperger's (Thiel), an eye that “cannot choose but to see” (Wordsworth), and the “poet, the artist,
          the sleuth--whoever sharpens our perception tends to be antisocial, rarely ‘well-adjusted,’ he cannot go along
          with currents and trends” (McLuhan, Quentin Fiore, 88). To summarize the previous statement, diversity of
          thought, character, and friends are infinitely valuable. “Treat humanity... never merely as a means to an end,
          but always at the same time as an end” (Kant, Metaphysics on Morals). My college admissions essay centered
          around my decision to avoid trying “to be” (John Boyd), and to focus on “doing” (John Boyd) - I still hold to
          that.</p>
        <p><strong>Goals and Aspirations:</strong> I love building (facing hard problems and making a big impact).
          <i>How you do one thing is how you do everything.</i> If something isn't worth all of me, it isn't worth doing
          at all, or I need to be giving my all anyways. I plan to use my mathematical background to study the world
          around me, software as a tool, and psychology to understand how to implement solutions in a humane,
          human-in-the-loop, and people-first way.</p>
