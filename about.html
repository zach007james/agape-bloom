        <p>I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in computer science and mathematics (and a minor in psychology) at Louisiana State University.<!-- You can
          see my projects in the <a href="archive.html">archive</a> or my public code on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zach007james">GitHub</a>.--></p>
        <p>Liberally, I am minoring in psychology, in the Ogden honors college, occasionally write and produce music,
          and study philosophy, management (Lencioni), and theology outside the classroom. I enjoy time with real people
          and sharing real food.</p>
        <p>While I currently busy focusing on school, I am planning to generate short-form content on my <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/zach007james">X</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM9BmcwqL-VRjtNs96iuNow">YouTube</a>, and my <a href="archive.html">archive</a> (which also includes longer essays, scripts, and applications) from summaries and content I have developed offline. I hope these platforms will give me an outlet to practice
          writing (thinking), grow by teaching, and build the habit of shipping where I am required to set goals, define
          objectives, and execute a plan to completion in absence of instruction, oversight, immediate gratification, or
          artificial gamification and feedback metrics (like the ones I experience in school).</p>

      <h2>Values & Ethics</h2>
      <div class="values-text">
        <p><strong>Religion:</strong> God and family - sine qua non and here my heart lies, in respective priority. There is truth to the observation that “if
        someone can be easily converted to ‘religion’ X, a further conversion to ‘religion’ Y is likely” (Bjarne Stroustrup,
        D&E, 24), that mass movements infect people with a malady to then turn around and offer that malady as a cure, that
        freedom “places the whole blame of failure on the shoulders of the individual... [and we] join a mass movement to escape
        individual responsibility” (Eric Hoffer, True Believer, 31 & 54). The fact that religion is a crutch for the vulnerable
        does not invalidate it: chicken pot pie is still better than escargot. Nietzsche declared God dead, then God declared
        Nietzsche dead. We all serve, strive for, and chase something, and the claim that one can achieve enlightenment or
        become an Übermensch, escaping the inescapable realities of suffering and death (Gen. 1-3) is delusion. The human heart
        longs for a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue (John Eldredge, Wild at Heart). I try to
        follow the following advice from a leader I respect: “Achieve the maximal amount you can achieve. Be the servant who, when his master left,
        earned the most return on that which he had been entrusted. Do what you do to God’s glory. ... If Godly ambition has
        placed us in a position of power, then we should empty ourselves of personal ambition/selfishness and take on the form
        of a servant/slave to become the leader whom God wishes us to be” (S.B.C. on Matthew 10:15 & 10:42-45). With this
        perspective, I can “eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of
        his life that God has given him.... For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied
        with joy in his heart” (Ecclesiastes 5:18-20), with the knowledge that all is vanity EXCEPT in Christ, everything
        matters. Thus, as Augustine says, “Love God and do what you will.” On the other hand, I am definitely not a delusional
        Presbyterian Calvinist, “so thankful that God chose me.” God knocks at everyone's door (Revelation 3:20) and desires all
        people to be saved (Matthew 22:14).
        </p>
        <p><strong>View of Salvation:</strong> There is no argument to logically convince one of the existence of Christ. Trying to debate or force someone into
        salvation, dehumanizing them to a sales lead is Pharisaical, dichotomous to a relational Christ. Christian apologetics
        is circular - a relationship with Christ first involves faith in the existence of Christ and then surrendering to Him as
        Lord, not a debate between arguments backed by reasoning and hidden inference that will be debunked by new reasoning in
        the future. Suffering and pain is the result of sin, the result of our free will to deviate from this good. Hell is “the
        punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might” (9) for “those
        who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel” (8) (1 Thessalonians 1), an “eternal fire prepared for the
        devil and his angels” (Matthew 25:41) while heaven is where God dwells among the people (Revelation 21:3). Eternal life
        and salvation is knowing “the only true God, and Jesus Christ” (John 17:3), where Christ states “I am the way and the
        truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6). 1 John 5:11-12: “And this is the
        testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not
        have the Son of God does not have life.” Ultimately, a relationship with Christ is individual and does not ultimately
        rest on the behavior of my coworkers, family, friends, or people who profess to follow Christ, or my local church.
        Speaking of being an individual...
        </p>
        <p><strong>Breaking Rules, Skepticism, and Libertarian Tilt:</strong> General Douglas MacArthur famously said that you are remembered for the rules you break. Marx supposably said, with the
        same accuracy of his views on socialism, that “obedience is for dogs.” I will not blindly bark, but I strive to honor
        Christ, submitting to Biblical authority. In practice, this looks like obeying a boss at work (because I have chosen to
        work there and submit myself to their authority), carrying out their instructions in service of Christ - my ultimate
        authority - “not as eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the
        heart, rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he
        will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or free” (Ephesians 6:6-8). When worldly rules run counter
        to Scripture, I will not compromise. Not at the cost of my reputation, job, life, or expense of my family. Growing up as
        a military child, I had the privilege of moving every 6 months to 4 years, so I was partially home-, charter-, and
        public-schooled, allowing me to experience different norms, cultures, and environments around the world and the United
        States. Public school is largely compliance training that teaches students to buy stuff to fit in and follow
        instructions (Seth Godin): the idea of blindly obeying and trusting an assigned authority figure, artificial grade
        metrics, and having to raise my hand to go to he bathroom always rubbed me the wrong way. As Naval describes the modern
        struggle as this: “Lone individuals summoning inhuman willpower, fasting, meditating, and exercising, up against armies
        of scientists & statisticians weaponizing abundant food, screens, & medicine into junk food, clickbait news, infinite
        porn, endless games & addictive drugs.” Rational Asperger's (Thiel), an eye that “cannot choose but to see”
        (Wordsworth), and the “poet, the artist, the sleuth--whoever sharpens our perception tends to be antisocial, rarely
        ‘well-adjusted,’ he cannot go along with currents and trends” (McLuhan, Quentin Fiore, 88) are necessary. “Treat
        humanity... never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end” (Kant, Metaphysics on Morals). My
        college admissions essay centered around my decision to avoid playing status games to try “to be” (John Boyd), but
        rather to focus on genuine relationships with people who have a good heart and work hard (‘thrust’ - like Saul), because
        life is better off when you focus less on status and more on doing whatever God has called you to do for His glory (He
        can pivot any ‘vector’ to transform Saul to Paul).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Plans, Aspirations, and What Drives Me:</strong> I have always enjoyed creating, whether that is music, a wood carving, or website. I want to do work that matters, so I
        always try to ask ‘where is the highest leverage?’ This does not mean that some work is ‘too low’ (beyond compromising
        my ethics, I am willing to do whatever it takes) but I aim towards work of great impact and challenging, stressful
        environments. I am like my mom in a sense that I am an empath (I genuinely hurt when others do), highly conscientious,
        and somewhat creative. I work extremely hard and constantly have to be doing something like my dad. If I’m not doing
        things that are extremely difficult or stressful, I have a crippling boredom which I satiate by going and doing harder
        things and more things like exercise and challenges that introduce healthy stress. Some people can get excited by
        watching a movie or getting drunk on the weekends, but those things are disinteresting. I am happy to, on rare
        occasions, have a beer or drink a glass of wine or watch a movie with friends or on a date night, but overall, I believe
        that my time on this earth is precious and I should be spending it doing what God put my on this earth to do. Software,
        business, design, and working to be an ideal team player and leader are very impactful. I know that having a strong core
        mathematical knowledge paired with an understanding of software will allow me to tackle and solve hard problems at
        scale, with no marginal cost of replication. Using systems thinking is a powerful skill that an understanding of
        computer science, design, and business allows me to merge while also using mathematics to quantitatively assess
        environments and psychology to understand how to integrate those solutions in a humane, human-in-the-loop, and
        people-first way. Before I graduate, I am looking for challenging work where I can learn by attaching hard problems,
        make a difference, and earn enough money to eat, afford the occasional new book, and pay for additional flight hours.
        After I graduate, I aspire to be a fighter pilot. After seeing an F-15 take off, I can’t see myself doing anything else:
        it is what I am busy working towards. While I, as a 19-year-old student am sure many things will change, I currently am
        very dissatisfied with the lack of affordable and healthy options for real food there are, especially late at night.
        Once day, later in life, I would like to start something that can give a seed oil free, processed sugar free, processed
        carbs free, and junk-free food alternative at scale and a low cost to give a simple, delicious, and healthy option of
        real food for real people, not just in posh areas.
