        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Zach James, founder of Agape Bloom - I am currently working on finishing dual-degrees in computer science 
          and mathematics, with a second discipline in psychology and concentration in data science, respectively.  
          In my free time, I enjoy creating music, running, writing, and exploring philosophy and theology. I have provided
          a summary of the values we hold and stick to below. </p>

        <p><strong>Values and Ethics:</strong> The human heart longs for a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a
          beauty to rescue (John Eldredge, Wild at Heart).  I try to follow the following advice a Godly person once gave
          me: “Achieve the maximal amount you can achieve. Be the servant who, when his master left, earned the most
          return on that which he had been entrusted. Do what you do to God’s glory. ... If Godly ambition has placed us
          in a position of power, then we should empty ourselves of personal ambition/selfishness and take on the form
          of a servant/slave to become the leader whom God wishes us to be” (Mr. B on Matthew 10:15 & 10:42-45). With
          this perspective, I can “eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun
          the few days of his life that God has given him.... For he will not much remember the days of his life because
          God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart” (Ecclesiastes 5:18-20). Thus, as Augustine says, “Love God and
          do what you will.”  In this context, I strive to do great work, "not as eye service, as people pleasers, but as
          bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart" (Ephesians 6:66-7).  In my college application essay, 
          I wrote about choosing authenticity over conformity and the popular definition of 'cool.'  This has blessed me with
          the freedom to work with people who have a good heart and strong values - and extends to the clients I choose to work with.
          Instead of falling into blind competition (Thiel and Naval), I try to realize that that those with an eye that "cannot 
          choose but to see" (Wordsworth) and the "poet, the artist, the sleuth - whoever sharpens our perception tends to be 
          antisocial, rarely 'well-adjusted,' he cannot go along with currents and trends" (McLuhan, Quentin Fiore, 88).
          Knowing this, if you do great work and have similar values, and agree with the Kantian statement that we should
          "treat humanity... never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end" (Metaphysics on Morals),
          let's get in contact and build something great!</p>

        
        <p><strong>Our Philosophy:</strong><i>How you do one thing is how you do everything.</i> If something isn't worth all of me, it isn't worth doing
          at all, or I need to be giving my all anyways. This extends to the way we serve our clients and partners.</p>
